# Definition: git status

The git status command returns the state of the directory in which you are working. it will show the status of any tracked files, whether they have been committed or not. furthermore, it will also state which files have been staged and whether the local repository is ahead of (and by how many commits) the remote repository. Git status is also useful when dealing with merge conflicts. 

Using the jupyter lab IDE the same information can be accessed via the git sidebar under the *changes* bar which uses a graphical interface to show the status of the files and repository.
